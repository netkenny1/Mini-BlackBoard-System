Java Individual Project: Console-Based Mini Blackboard System

Submission Deadline: November 2, 2025, at 23:59

1. Project Description

For your individual project, you will build a console-based Mini Blackboard System, a simplified version of Blackboard (a learning management system).
This application will manage the relationships between students, teachers, and courses.

Imagine you are a software developer building the core engine for this new LMS.
When the project is complete, the system will support a full academic workflow through a text-based interface.

Example scenario:

An administrator logs in to create a new “Java Programming” course and a teacher account for Dr. Smith.

The administrator assigns Dr. Smith to the course and enrolls a student, Jane Doe.

Dr. Smith logs in, views her assigned course, and creates a “Homework 1” assignment.

Jane Doe logs in, views her course and assignment, and later checks her grade after Dr. Smith has graded it.

The primary goal of this project is to apply Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles — including Inheritance, Encapsulation, Abstraction, and Polymorphism — to design and implement a functional, well-structured system.

The entire application must run in the console, focusing on logic and design (no GUI).

2. Core System Features (MUST-HAVE)

Your application must successfully implement all of the following features.
All data must be saved to local files (e.g., .txt or .csv) when the application closes and reloaded when it starts, so that information persists between sessions.

General Features

Data Persistence:
The system must load its state from files on startup and save it to files on exit.

Login Mechanism:
The system must allow users to log in using credentials (e.g., user ID and password) and load the correct menu for their role.

Administrator Features

Create, update, and delete Student accounts (including user ID and password).

Create, update, and delete Teacher accounts (including login credentials).

Create and define new Courses.

Assign a Teacher to a specific course.

Enroll a Student in a specific course.

Teacher Features

View a list of all courses assigned to them.

View the list of students enrolled in each course.

Create new Assignments for a course.

Enter and update Grades for each student on a specific assignment.

Student Features

View the list of courses they are enrolled in.

For each course, view all assignments and their grades.

View their final calculated grade for each course.

3. Extending Functionality

You are encouraged to extend your system’s functionality beyond the core requirements.
Here are some suggested enhancements:

Course Capacity:
Add a maxCapacity to each course and prevent enrollment when full.

Prerequisites:
Allow courses to specify prerequisite courses.
Prevent a student from enrolling until prerequisites are passed.

Report Generation:
Enable administrators to generate .txt report files, such as:

Full student transcript

Class roster with grades

Announcements:
Allow teachers to post announcements for a course, which students can view.

4. Submission & Evaluation

Your final submission must be uploaded to Blackboard as a .zip file containing source code and documentation.

Submission Package

Source Code:
All .java files organized into logical packages.

README File:
Must include any information needed to run your project (e.g., admin credentials).

Design Document:
This is crucial for explaining your architecture and reasoning. It must include:

A UML Class Diagram showing the relationships between classes.

A detailed explanation of your design choices, including:

Why your classes are structured as they are.

Why you chose specific data structures.

How your file persistence system works.

Evaluation Criteria

Your grade will be based on:

Quality of OOP design.

Code readability and maintainability.

Ability to clearly explain your design decisions during a one-on-one code review.

During this review, you must demonstrate a clear understanding of your code and the principles you applied.
